# Broker integration overview

[View the overview documentation](https://github.com/HubTran/documentation/raw/master/high_level_overview.pdf)

When integrating, we offer two different options. We highly recommend using our [REST API](https://github.com/HubTran/documentation/blob/master/brokers/rest.md) with approved invoices sent using a [Webhook](https://github.com/HubTran/documentation/blob/master/brokers/webhook.md). Alternatively, we offer a less full featured [CSV Integration](https://github.com/HubTran/documentation/blob/master/brokers/csv.md).
